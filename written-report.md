### Observable 1: Latitude vs Max Temperature

I expected to be hotter at 23.5 degrees south latitude because the Sun is directly overhead during the winter solstice, due to Earth's 23.5 tilted axis. However, when we fit a parabola to the data, the max temperature is at 11 degrees south latitude. Although the Sun's position in the sky is one factor on city temperature, other natural phenomena like clouds can also affect the temperature. It is for this reason the max temperature for Dec 21st (UTC) is not at 23.5 degrees south latitude.

### Observable 2: Latitude vs Cloudiness

There are no obvious signs of correlation between latitude and cloudiness. The data seems to be uniformly spread across both directions.

### Observable 3: Latitude vs Humidity

The humidity seems to increase as you get closer to the Poles. At these high (or low) latitudes the air is dryer and there is very little water vapor is the air because of the colder temperatures. Although it is not cold, the humidity near 11 degrees south latitude seems to increase as well. One possibility might be due to large areas of water near these latitudes. While the Sun is shinning directly overhead it has a higher chance of evaporating water into the air and thus increasing humidity, making it hot and muggy.
