### Observable 1: Latitude vs Max Temperature

I expected to be hotter at 23.5 degrees south latitude because the Sun is directly overhead during the winter solstice, due to Earth's 23.5 tilted axis. However, when we fit a parabola to the data, the max temperature is at 11 degrees south latitude. Although the Sun's position in the sky is one factor on city temperature, other natural phenomena like clouds can also affect the temperature. It is for this reason the max temperature for Dec 21st (UTC) is not at 23.5 degrees south latitude.
