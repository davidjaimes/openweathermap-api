### Background

Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, utilize a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
